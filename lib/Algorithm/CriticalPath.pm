=head1 SYNOPSIS

Performs a critical path analysis of a DAG where the vertices have costs, and the edges do not.
All costs are assumed positive.  Dummy Start and End nodes are used internally to aid the analysis.

The constructor takes a pre-constructed Graph object with weighted vertices and simple directed edges.  The Graph object is embedded
in the Algorithm::CriticalPath object as a readonly attribute, and cannot be updated once the Algorithm::CriticalPath object has been constructed.  
The two accessor attributes are 'rw', as I haven't found an easy way to default them from the constructor. They should be 'ro', i.e. not modifiable
once set by the constructor.

The module checks that the passed-in Graph object is directed, non-cyclic, and simply connected, without multi-vertices and without multi-edges.

The module has been written on the assumption that no existing CPAN module performs this task.


=head1 METHODS

=head2 C<new>

=over 4

=item * C<< Algorithm::CriticalPath->new() >>

Creates and returns a new Algorithm::CriticalPath object. 

    my $g = Graph->new(directed => 1);
    $g->add_weighted_vertex('Node1', 1);
    $g->add_weighted_vertex('Node2', 2);
    $g->add_edge('Node1','Node2');
    $g->add_weighted_vertex('Node3', 0.5);
    $g->add_edge('Node1','Node3');
    
    my $cp = Algorithm::CriticalPath->new( {graph => $g} );


=back


=head2 C<vertices>

=over 4

=item * C<< $g->vertices() >>

This returns the critical path as an array of node names.

    my $g = Graph->new(directed => 1);
    $g->add_weighted_vertex('Node1', 1);
    $g->add_weighted_vertex('Node2', 2);
    $g->add_edge('Node1','Node2');
    $g->add_weighted_vertex('Node3', 0.5);
    $g->add_edge('Node1','Node3');
    
    my $cp = Algorithm::CriticalPath->new( {graph => $g} );
    my @orderednodes = $cp->vertices();

    
=back    

=head2 C<cost>

=over 4

=item * C<< $g->cost() >>

This returns the critical path cost.

    my $g = Graph->new(directed => 1);
    $g->add_weighted_vertex('Node1', 1);
    $g->add_weighted_vertex('Node2', 2);
    $g->add_edge('Node1','Node2');
    $g->add_weighted_vertex('Node3', 0.5);
    $g->add_edge('Node1','Node3');
    
    my $cp = Algorithm::CriticalPath->new( {graph => $g} );
    my $cost = $cp->cost();
